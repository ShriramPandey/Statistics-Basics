        "\n",
        "*   **Measures of Central Tendency:** Mean, median, and mode (e.g., the average height of students in a class).\n",
        "*   **Measures of Dispersion:** Range, variance, and standard deviation (e.g., the spread of test scores).\n",
        "*   **Frequency Distributions:** Tables or graphs showing how often each value occurs (e.g., a bar chart showing the number of people in different age groups).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Inferential Statistics** use data from a sample to make inferences or predictions about a larger population. They allow us to draw conclusions beyond the data we have directly observed, often involving probability. Examples include:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Hypothesis Testing:** Determining if there is enough evidence to support a claim about a population (e.g., testing if a new drug is more effective than an old one).\n",

        "- **Sampling** in statistics is the process of selecting a subset of individuals or items from a larger population to collect data and make inferences about the entire population. It's often impractical or impossible to collect data from every member of a population, so sampling allows us to gather representative data efficiently.\n",

        "    *   In simple random sampling, every member of the population has an equal and independent chance of being selected for the sample.\n",
        "    *   This method helps minimize bias and ensures that the sample is likely representative of the population.\n",
        "    *   Think of it like drawing names out of a hat – each name has the same chance of being picked.\n",
        "    *   **Example:** To survey student opinions in a school, you could assign a number to each student and use a random number generator to select a sample of students.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Stratified Sampling:**\n",
        "    *   In stratified sampling, the population is divided into subgroups (strata) based on shared characteristics (e.g., age, gender, income level).\n",
        "    *   Then, a random sample is taken from *each* stratum.\n",
        "    *   This method is useful when you want to ensure that certain subgroups are adequately represented in your sample, especially if those subgroups are small relative to the overall population.\n",
        "    *   **Example:** If you are surveying voters and want to ensure representation from different age groups, you could divide the population into age strata (e.g., 18-25, 26-40, 41-60, 60+) and then randomly select a certain number of voters from each stratum.\n",

        "*   **Random Sampling:** Selects individuals from the entire population randomly.\n",

        "\n",
        "Stratified sampling can be more complex to implement than simple random sampling but can provide a more representative sample when dealing with diverse populations and the need to ensure representation of specific subgroups."

        "\n",
        "Choosing the appropriate measure of central tendency depends on the type of data and the goal of the analysis. For example, the median is often preferred over the mean when dealing with skewed data or outliers because it is less affected by extreme values."
